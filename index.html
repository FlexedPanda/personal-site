                    <h3>Coding</h3>
                    <p>I didn't have any coding background till admitting in BRAC university. Felt left behind due to that fact. But interestingly I found fun in coding, I loved the logistics behind codes. Completed my Cse220 Course till date.</p>

                    <h3>Cubing</h3>
                    <p>I starded cubing since class 9. But I at that time just knew how to solve a cube, nothing much. A turn took-over me during class 10. I was amazed by speedcubing then. But as a regret, coundn't achieve sub-20 myself. My average of 5 solves is 23.08 secs.</p>

                    <h3>Chess</h3>
                    <p>Found chess too much interesting. I loved the strategic moves that you need to think and strategize every moves and plan ahead in the game of chess. Thus, I grew a fan for chess during class 7. Also was in college's chess club. My rating is roughly 1200.</p>

                    <h3>Coffee</h3>
                    <p>Man, I love coffee. My love for coffee can't be described in words. My mother's coffee is the best for me. Whenever I get a free moment, without a cup of coffee feels like emptiness for me. Fun fact, I drink coffee 5 times a day.</p>

                    <h3>Valorant</h3>
                    <p>Valorant is my 1st full fledged pc game. The cometativeness in valorant makes me play it more. I truly love the tactical fps aspect of valorant. Spent over 10k on skins. I'm maily a controller main. My peak rank is Platinum 1 with 64 RR.</p>
